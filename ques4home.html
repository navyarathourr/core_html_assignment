   <p style="font-size: large ;">Hi, My name is Navya Rathour and I am a Business Analyst by profession. I completed my Bcom(Hons) from ARSD, Delhi University and MCOM from IGNOU. I was scared of sliding into the techgnical world due to my non-tech background. <br /> Despite many challenges and hurdles, here I am trying to have hands on experience on the same. <br />I started my coding journey through this platform and there's no going back since then. I didn't even know a single word ablut coding and now day by day I am getting more confident with my skills. <br /> <strong>There's a mile to go!!</strong></p>
